## Steps to Create the Project
1. **Defining the functionality**: Discuss with the team to outline the key features of the project, such as user authentication, event selection, ticket purchasing, and order management.
2. **Designing the interface**: Create prototypes for the main pages (homepage, event page, and purchase page) using design tools like Figma.
3. **Setting up the development environment**: Install all necessary tools and software (development environment, version control systems) and set up a GitHub repository for collaborative work.
4. **Developing the backend**: Build the server-side functionality to handle requests, manage the database, and provide user authentication.
5. **Developing the frontend**: Create a user-friendly interface and connect it to the backend via APIs.
6. **Testing**: Test each feature (authentication, payment, ticket management) both manually and using automated tools.
7. **Building and deploying**: Once development is complete, set up hosting or a server to make the application accessible to users.
8. **Demonstration and improvement**: Present the project, gather feedback, and make improvements based on the input.
